APTrust Exchange Go Services
===

A role which installs and manages Exchange Go Services for ingest and restore of APTrust repository objects.

To limit deployment to ingest, restore or ingest&restore services the role can be called with `ansible-playbook exchange.yml -e ex_services=(all|ingest|restore)`. The default is to deploy all services on a single server. The default variables keep a nested list of Go services for each purpose.

After the github repo has been pulled and Go apps have been compiled, the environment-dependent (development/demo/production) configuration is being updated according to default values and go_env setting.

Some of the configuration has to be kept in Ansible as many variables create dependencies to other services.

At last, supervisor configuration is being written according to the list of edeployed services. All services are grouped under `exchange` (i.e. exchange:apt_fetch` and therefore have to be called that way to be restarted or checked on status.

Requirements
------------
This role is designed to be deployed on a Ubuntu Linux system.
It requires supervisor, nsq and golang to be installed.

retr0h.nsq
